# Download Links

## Overview

This page shows how you can create a link that will cause a file to be
downloaded when clicked.

## Example

Here is an example:

[Hello world code sample](./files/sample1.py){: download="hello.py"}

## Markdown

Here is the Markdown:

```MD
[Hello world code sample](./files/sample1.py){: download="hello.py"}
```

Note that the name specified after `download=` is the name the file will be
given when it is downloaded. This does not need to be the same as the name of
the file on the server side.
